#Description
English Version of draughts (checkers)

#How To Play
white goes first
click on the square you wish to move from
click on the square you wish to move to
move diagonally and jump a oposite colour to take the oppositions piece
reach the oppositions end to be crowned a king that can move backword and forward

#Todo
validation on where you can move (you can move sideways etc  at the moment)
english rules state that if you take opposistion piece then i you can take anothe piece then you must ('needs to be don next')
check if a plyer can move or not to find out if the game was one or not
make the counter images better
clear the 2 input fileds after each move some times they both need to be cleared before you can move if you accdently
click an empty square first

#Things I Would Change If I Was To Do It Again
remove the letters and numbers from the side of the board
add numbers to dark square only(this will make calculating moves easier as you can only move diagnally anyway no
white squares will ever be used)
